<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal">This model is network-based, 
  where a peer is an application able to connect to other peers, and let user's 
  create categorized subjects and submit feedback on them. A peer represents that 
  subject specifically or commonly. A feedback is a value in a given range indicating 
  a user's personal view on the particular subject. Comments could be added to 
  feedback-values.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">A basic 
  set of rules for this feedback-network could be:</P>
<UL style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <LI> 
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> Each 
      peer is unique (ID)</P>
  <LI>Votes and rates are cast using authentication, integrity, and confidentiality 
  <LI>Authentication mechanisms are person-to-person based 
  <LI>Integrity and confidentiality is ensured using public key encryption 
  <LI>One peer can rate and/or vote another peer 
  <LI>Rates and votes may be authenticated or anonymous 
  <LI>The authenticity of a peer is public 
  <LI>A peer's rating/votes may be displayed public, in limited groups, or kept 
    private 
  <LI>A rate can be a value between 0 and 100 on any rate-subject 
  <LI>A vote is always the value 1 
  <LI>Rate-subjects and vote-subjects are categorized 
  <LI>One peer can only rate another peer once on a rate-subject 
  <LI>One peer can vote another peer once on a vote-subject 
  <LI>Rate- and/or vote-groups can be created 
  <LI>Groups are categorized, and include two or more subjects 
  <LI>Group ratings and votes are balanced in that the total amount of rates/votes 
    has to be distributed among the group subjects 
  <LI>Rates and votes may be updated at any time 
  <LI>Automatic updating mechanisms may be in place (if-then) 
  <LI>Update feedback-loops may be constructed between peers (if peer A votes 
    X, then vote Y on B) 
  <LI>The source (peer) of a rate/vote may be tracked

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> Examples 
  of Peer-based Feedback follow...</P>
<h2> <a name="rate"></a>Rating</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> Peers 
  A, B, and C submit their rating on a Subject S1 on peer D. The average rating 
  of all values (sum divided by count) is displayed at D. Since ratings are between 
  0 and 100, the average value will be in the same span. Subject S1 could be &ldquo;Delivery&rdquo; 
  in the category &ldquo;Business / Customers / Experience&rdquo;, and it's value 
  described as &ldquo;% Satisfaction&rdquo;.</P>

  <BR>
</P>
<h2><a name="vote"></a>Votes</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> Similar 
  to rating, votes can be counted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> <IMG SRC="images/ma-100303_html_m4fb60aab.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=315 HEIGHT=322 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<h2><a name="pfb"></a>Private Feedback</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> A scenario 
  where a peer E views at peer D's rating on a particular range of subjects. Since 
  D keeps S1 private, E can view S2, S3, and S4.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> <IMG SRC="images/ma-100303_html_m45f42df8.jpg" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=554 HEIGHT=267 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
</P>
<h2 STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><B><a name="afb"></a>Automated 
  Feedback</B></h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> This drawing 
  illustrates an optional auto-feedback mechanism, that lets a peer B rate a peer 
  D based on peer A's rating. Before submitting it's rating on subject S4, peer 
  B first inquires A's rating on the same subject. Based on this value and the 
  relationship to A, peer B can adjust it's rating on D.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> <IMG SRC="images/ma-100303_html_m72ac8960.jpg" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=411 HEIGHT=235 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  <BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium"> Subject 
  S4 could in this situation be &ldquo;Support of War in Iraq&rdquo; in the category 
  &ldquo;Politics / Global Diplomacy / Current Events&rdquo;, where D could be 
  a public discussion group, and A a political representative (or an index of 
  the Oil-price).</P>
<h2> <a name="afbf"></a>Auto-Feedback Formulas</h2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">A closer look at the automated 
  feedback-mechanism. Peer D receives feedback from different peers (1) on subject 
  S1. Internally, it can distinguish the feedback (2) by differentiating between 
  anonymous and authenticated feedback, feedback that was submitted during a specific 
  period of time, or feedback that was auto-created.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Peer D could ask other peers, 
  such as peer E, to give their feedback on subject S1 (3). Or peer E itself is 
  interested in submitting feedback to peer D. If subject S1 is of a certain type, 
  it might be useful for E to automate it's feedback on that particular subject, 
  no matter which peer is asking. Peer E thus reads the existing feedback (4) 
  from peer D, and possibly gathers information from interrelated peers (not shown).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Peer E could create an auto-feedback 
  formula (5) that determines it's rating on subject S1 by some factors. In the 
  case below, E would not rate at all on S1 for D if the total feedback D received 
  (yellow) was from less than 30 peers. If the last 10 feedback's were within 
  4 weeks (red), E would notify it's user, maybe because the high activity requires 
  special attention. Otherwise, E's rate on S1 (orange) would depend on the sum 
  of those peers that rated with authentication (green) and those peers that E 
  in particular trusts (pink). Excluding those feedbacks that themselves are based 
  on formulas (light blue), might provide a better result. In other words, peer 
  E bases it's rate on it's trusted peers and all those not anonymous, but none 
  that use auto-feedback.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><IMG SRC="images/ma-100303_html_m3dd8b166.jpg" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=554 HEIGHT=522 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
  <BR>
  Subject S1 could in this instance be &ldquo;Network Uptime&rdquo; in the category 
  &ldquo;Sun / Clusters&rdquo;, i.e. monitor E supports whatever other clusters 
  and external customers think of cluster D, as long as their rating is not automated. 
  Or maybe &ldquo;Food quality on Campus&rdquo;, i.e. if you think the food is 
  good and a lot of people put their name under the same statement, I agree, too.</P>
